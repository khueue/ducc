The source and executables are available on the IT department server at:
/home/emhe9781/src/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Previous reports can be found in the project folder under `report`.

(Note that the source won't compile and the executables won't run on the IT
department servers. The servers have an old release of Erlang installed as
default which doesn't include Leex nor escript).
