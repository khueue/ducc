The source and executables are available on the IT department server at:
/home/emhe9781/src/XXX

(Note that the source won't compile and the executables won't run on the IT
department servers. The servers have an old release of Erlang installed as
default which doesn't include Leex nor escript).

## Introduction

In this report, we will briefly discuss our attempt to implement a
translation from the abstract syntax tree (AST) into a flat, RTL-like,
intermediate representation for the uC language.

We started out by implementing a depth-first search algorithm for traversing
the AST. The translator starts at the root node (`program`) and recursively
translates its children in a left-to-right order.

## Tools Used

Erlang provides a module `dict`, which implements a key-value dictionary. We
use `dict` to implement the symbol table in our environment.

Documentation for `dict`: <http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dict.html>

## Translator Environment

The environment is implemented in `src/translator/translator_env.erl`.

The environment has the form:

    {LastUsedTemp, LastUsedLabel, CurrentScopeData, Scopes}

#### LastUsedTemp

`LastUsedTemp` is used to denote the last used temporary register, and has
the form:

    {temp, TempId}

The temporary registers are used for actual parameters and local scalar
variables.

`TempId` is an integer value which starts at 0. `{temp, 0}` is reserved for
the return value. `{temp, 1}` is reserved for the virtual frame pointer
(which is used for local array variables). The next free temporary register
is `{temp, 2}`.

Note that `LastUsedTemp` is preserved when leaving a scope.

#### LastUsedLabel

`LastUsedLabel` is used to denote the last used label, and has the form:

    {label, LabelId}

The labels are used for global variables.

`LabelId` is an integer value which is set to 99 in a new environment, denoting
that the next free label is `{label, 100}`.

Note that `LastUsedLabel` is preserved when leaving a scope.

#### CurrentScopeData

`CurrentScopeData` contains data about the current scope (i.e. function), and
has the form:

    {StartLabel, EndLabel, FrameSize}

The `StartLabel` and `EndLabel` are labels of the same form as indicated by
`LastUsedLabel` above. Although they are the start and end label of the
current scope. Initially when entering a scope, `StartLabel` and `EndLabel`
is set to `nil`.

`FrameSize` is an integer value which denotes the frame size of the current
scope.  and Initially when entering a scope, `FrameSize` is set to 0.

Note that `CurrentScopeData` is not preserved when leaving a scope.

#### Scopes

`Scopes` is a stack of scopes. The head of the `Scopes` stack (which is just
a list) is the current scope. Each scope has the form:

    {ScopeName, SymTab}

`ScopeName` is either the name of a function represented as a string,
or the atom `global` if the translator happens to be looking at the top-level.
`SymTab` is a dictionary as returned by `dict:new()`.

For example, if the translator is currently investigating the function `main`,
the environment will look like:

    {LastUsedTemp, LastUsedLabel, CurrentScopeData, [{"main", SymTab1}, {global, SymTab0}]}

The scope stack will never grow beyond two elements because the only
scope-introducing construct in uC is the function. Nevertheless, a stack
is a natural and convenient representation of scopes.

### Symbol Tables

XXX different kind of nodes compared to the analyzer?

Each symbol table is represented by an Erlang dictionary. When we encounter
a new declaration, its identifier is used as the key, and its entire AST node
is used as the associated value. This provides us with all the information we
need (and more), and we do not need to devise new data types. On the
downside, this probably involves more copying than necessary.

## Running the Translator

### Multi-Step Compilation

The translator (as all previous steps) has been implemented to read from
standard input and output to standard output.
As such it's possible to, for example, pipe the result from the lexer to the
parser, from the parser to the analyzer, and from the analyzer to the
translator:

    cat suite/quiet/rtl/r01.c | lexer | parser | analyzer | translator

If the translator encounters an error, it will print a error message to
standard output and stop evaluation. Otherwise, if successful, the translator
will output the RTL code to standard output.

### Single-Step Compilation

For a more conventional approach to compilation, a script called `ducc` can
be used. `ducc` takes a single file as argument and runs all (implemented)
successive steps on it, and prints the result to standard output:

    ducc file.c

### Error Handling

When a script (such as `translator`) receives invalid input, an error message
is printed and execution stops.

An error exhibited by the translator looks like:
