## Introduction

Our compiler will be written in Erlang. Neither of us has any previous
experience with Erlang, so we hope this to be both challenging and fun.

This assignment involves creating a lexer (lexical analyser) for the uC
language (a subset of C), so this is what the report will focus on:
understanding the lexical part of uC, learning Leex and arriving at a
(hopefully) working lexer.

## Tools Used

### Leex

Thankfully, the Erlang environment provides ports of both Lex and Yacc, namely
Leex and Yecc. Leex documentation can be found here:
<http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/leex.html>

#### Input File

Leex takes as input a file with token definitions and gives as output a
customized Erlang module, specifically molded from the token definitions.

The definitions file has the following format:

    <Header>

    Definitions.
    <Macro Definitions>

    Rules.
    <Token Rules>

    Erlang code.
    <Erlang code>

We have no "Header" section, but the other sections are present. The sections
are defined as follows:

 * _Macro Definitions_. Named regular expressions, to make the rules more
     readable and avoid duplication.
 * _Rules_. Pairs of "Regexp : Erlang code". When Regexp matches input, the
     the corresponding Erlang code is executed, usually emitting a token for
     the input matched.
 * _Erlang code_. Any additional code needed by the above.

## Handling Comments

### Single-Line Comments

Single-line comments, //, are handled by the simple regexp:

    {LineComment}(.*)

where LineComment is defined as //. The dot regexp does not match newline in
Leex, so we did not have to handle that specifically.

### Multi-Line Comments 

Handling multi-line comments, /* */, was the trickiest part of the lexer.
We eventually arrived at the following expression:

    {MultiCommentStart}(/*){InComment}*(\**){MultiCommentEnd}

where MultiCommentStart is /* and MultiCommentEnd is */. The tricky part
is what is between: Immediately after the start, any number of slashes may be
present. Then comes a lot of stuff, and just before the closing marker is any
number of stars. The stuff in between that, InComment, is defined as:

    ([^*/]|[^*]/|\*[^/])

This prohibits the sequences /* and */ from appearing inside the comment,
but anything else is allowed. This combined should be able to cope with
proper multi-line comments in uC (and C).

## Handling EOF

Since we are using Leex to create the lexical analyser we didn't need to 
handle eof explicitly. 

## main.erl 

To perform lexical analysis on the input from a stream, e.g. a uC source file
, and to output the result to the standard output we used the erlang file and
io modules.

The function start in the module main takes a file name as an argument and
opens a stream, which is passed to the function process_file.
The function process_file uses the io:request/2 function which uses the 
generated lexer in order to tokenize the input stream.
Upon seeing a valid token, the token and its value is printed to standard 
output using the io:format/2 function. If it sees an error, there's a
lexical error in the input stream and an error message will be printed to
standard output.
